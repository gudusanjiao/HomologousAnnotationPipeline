1. **QuickAnnotPipeline.md** Using liftoff to quickly annotate genome assembly with closed related species gff3 file
2. **PlottingSynteny.md** Using R to plot the synteny between two selected genome based on gff3 file
3. **NSandSsite.md** Using R to identify synonymous and non-synonymous site of a vcf file
4. **dS.md** Using R to calculate dS between species
